## General_and_important_information

The manual describes the most important functions of the fiskaltrust.portal. Also note the abbreviations in the "List of abbreviations"

The individual pages described are sometimes called up with delays of up to 60 seconds. This is due to the fact that some very complex processes, such as a database search, are carried out in the background.

As many details on the fulfilment of the cash register obligation in 2016 were published at very short notice and not all processes can yet be tested on a larger scale (e.g. nationwide registration via Finanz Online), we apologise for any errors in the start-up phase. For larger applications, please contact our team in advance.

We are pleased about any information for the improvement of our services.

(see chapter "[Overview of roles and contractual relationships](#overview_of_roles_and_contractual_relationships)")

example_in_which"no-role"_is_assigned

If a user has been assigned authorization to manage master data (or is the primary contact), these functions are available to the user.

With the authorization to conclude a contract, the user can enter into the contractual relationships of the company. In this case, the contract is concluded in absentia.

### Company_role_CashSys_manufacturer

This section describes how a company can activate and deactivate the role of a CashSys manufacturer. The respective contractual agreements between fiskaltrust consulting gmbh and the company can be concluded or terminated.

The roles CashSys dealer, consultant and CashSys operator are assigned in the same way, which is why the technical representation of these roles is omitted in this document.

#### Cooperation_agreement_CashSys_manufacturer

This function enables companies to use the role of a CashSys manufacturer in the ft.portal. Thus all functions of a CashSys manufacturer, e.g. the creation and administration of employees, cash register products or CashSys dealers are available to him in the ft.Portal.

- Sales tax identification number (UID)
- Global Location Number (GLN)
- Tax office and tax number (St.Nr.)

is entered correctly.

For the UID or tax number, the data check (on the right side) must also be clicked and checked for its correctness. If an error occurs, the classification key must be corrected and checked again. Your tax advisor or CashSys dealer can help you with any questions you may have about the classification term.

1\) Sales tax identification number (UID)

- Example: ATU12345678

2\) Global Location Number (GLN)

- Inquiry: [http://www.gepir.at](http://www.gepir.at)
- Example: 1234567890123

3\) Tax office and tax number (St.Nr.)

The tax office and tax number must be entered in the following form:

- Tax office number (two digits) and
- Tax number (seven digits)
- without separator and without blank space
- Example: Tax office Linz (46), tax number 123 / 4567; correct input: 461234567.

![Number 4](Numbers/4.png) The "company register number" is not required for the functionality of the signature creation.

![Number 5](Numbers/5.png) "UID number" with leading "ATU" and the 8-digit number. The UID number is the preferred classification term that is used for the signature creation.

Principally, all companies can apply for a UID number.

Companies that do not have a UID number can use the GLN or the tax number as a classification term for the certificates.

![Number 6](Numbers/6.png) "GLN" The Global Location Number of a company can be queried e.g. via the WKO Firmen A-Z ([https://firmen.wko.at/](https://firmen.wko.at/)) or the company service portal ([https://www.usp.gv.at](https://www.usp.gv.at)).

"Tax number" \[The check of the tax number via the EU portal can temporarily lead to the error message (505) Bad Gateway.\]

### Checking_the_company's_classification_terms

![Number 7](Numbers/7.png) After entering the UID number or the tax number as a filing key, they are to be saved. Then you should check an order key with the button ![Questionmark](Buttons/001.png "Questionmark").

The positive check is absolutely necessary for the later assignment of ONE classification term for the automated personalization of a signature creation device (SmartCard)\!

This example of a check result shows that the company name entered in the company master data (above) does not correspond to the data stored in the company register.

After adjusting the name of the company, saving it again and clicking on ![Questionmark](Buttons/001.png "Questionmark"), the check is carried out again. If the classification key is checked and the master data are now correct - with few deviations - the check leads to a positive result.

### Invitation_of_CashSys_operators_by_CashSys_dealers

The invitation of a CashSys operator can only be made by a CashSys dealer, but not by a manufacturer or consultant.

However, the role of a CashSys dealer can also be activated by these companies and thus taken over in parallel to another role. (see chapter "[Company Role CashSys manufacturer](#company_role_cashsys_manufacturer)")

Screenshot 69: Invitation of the CashSys operators (POSOperator) by a CashSys dealer (POSDealer)

![Number 1](Numbers/1.png) The assignments of the CashSys operators can be found under the menu item "Invitations".

There are two ways to add CashSys operators to a CashSys dealer:

1. ![Number 2](Numbers/2.png) add a single CashSys operator see chapter [Add CashSys operator](#add_cashsys_operator).
2. ![Number 3](Numbers/3.png) add several CashSys operators by importing a CSV file.
    1. ![Number 4](Numbers/4.png)  The CSV file is to be imported and selected via \[Choose File\].
    2. ![Number 5](Numbers/5.png)  Then the import is carried out by clicking on \[Import\].
    3. ![Number 6](Numbers/6.png)  The necessary structure of the CSV file is described using an example. This example can be obtained via \[Download demo CSV file\].

Screenshot 70: Add CashSys operator

CashSys operators can be added manually using this function. This is particularly interesting for the on-site support given by the CashSys dealer if a CashSys operator wants to use the ft.services immediately - in connection with the commissioning of a cash register.

The following fields are mandatory fields and must therefore be filled in:

- Contact E-Mail
- Contact First name
- Contact Surname
- company's name
- zip code
- location

This is to guarantee that the CashSys operator can be found correctly in the ft.portal via his e-mail address and can be assigned to the CashSys dealer.
